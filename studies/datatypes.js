// DATA TYPES:

// 0. Values of data is a data-type, or how we categorize data.
// There are 2 main types of data that we use in Javascript, Primitive Datatypes, and Complex Datatypes

// 1. Primitive Datatypes
// These datatypes are also immutable values(values, which are incapable of being changed)
//  JavaScript, there are 6 primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol

//  Types of Primitive Values:
// 2. Boolean Type

// These datatypes represent a logical entity and can have two values

var k = true; // k has a value of true
var i = false; // i has a vlue of false

// 3. Number type:
// there is no specific type for integers
// Javascript works with decimals numbers as well 

console.log(4.5 + 3.4); // => prints 7.9

k = 1 // k now has a value of the number 1
i = 5 // i now has a value of the number 5

// And + Infinity or -Infinity  

var maxNumber = Math.pow(10, 1000); // max positive number

if (maxNumber === Infinity) {
  console.log("Let's call it Infinity!");
  // expected output: "Let's call it Infinity!"
}

console.log(1 / maxNumber);
// expected output: 0 

// There are some special cases that you can us as NaN(not-a-number)

//NaN will never be equal to NaN
//You should never use them to compare one another
//strictly comparing them will not work => NaN === NaN
//ex.
k = NaN;

if(isNaN === k) {
    console.log("They are equal");
} else {
   console.log("These two numbers can't be compared");
}

// Now if you print var k to the console it will show as NaN
// NaN is not used often but can help determin if a value is a number or not-a-number

// 4. String Datatypes:
// Character data that must be inclosed with single or double quotes. '' or "".
// the reason why they are called strings is because it is a string (or an array) of characters.

k = 'This is a String';

// Strings can also be accessed like an array, if you use array-syntax or bracket notation you can get individual characters from the string

console.log(k[0]);

// This would print 't' to the console

// 5. Undefined
// This data type has no value or the variable is uninitialized.

var x;

console.log(x);

// This would print to the console undefined because x is not assigned a value.

// 6. null Datatype
// unlike undefined, null expresses a lack of Identification, indicating that a variable points to no object.

function getLetter(string) {
    var p = string.match(/[abcde]/gi);
    if (p === null) {
        return null;
    } else {
        return string.length;
    }
}
console.log(getLetter('fghijk'));

// This prints null to the console.

// Complex Data types:
// Object
// Array
// Function

// Complex data types can aggregate other values and can also be an indefinite size
// They also reference other data types when assigning or passing complex data also known as copy by reference

// Object Data:
// Objects in Javascript an be compared to objects in real life. 
//They use key/value pairs which define their characteristics.

// Basic layout of an object is almost like an array but instead of square brackets, 
//you use curly braces to identify that it is an object in Javascript

var hat = {
    color: 'blue',
    style: 'snapback',
}; 

// In an object, if a property is unassigned, the printed value is undefined.
// And objects can contain any number of key/value pairs
// and key/value pairs can also contain complex data as well.

var myObj = new Object(),
    str = 'myString',
    rand = Math.random(),
    obj = new Object();

myObj.type              = 'Dot syntax';
myObj['date created']   = 'String with space';  //=> bracket syntax
myObj[str]              = 'String value';
myObj[rand]             = 'Random Number';
myObj[obj]              = 'Object';
myObj['']               = 'Even an empty string';

console.log(myObj);

// ARRAY DATA TYPES:
// Used to store multiple values in a single variable.
// created using square brackets [] and separated with commas ,
// Also, arrays are zero-indexed list which means they start at the zero index

var cars = ['Accord', 'Mustang', 'Supra', 'S2000'];

// FUNCTIONS:
// One of the building blocks of Javascript
// a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.
// created usually by name, parameters are passed through the function by using parenthese ()
// the body of the function is used with curly brackets {}

function saidFunction(parameter) {
    //body of function
    return parameter;
}

// then the function can be called by passing arguments.

saidFunction('this is an argument');


/**Ex.
 * Copy by reference


When a reference type value, an object, is copied to another variable using =, 
the address of that value is whatâ€™s actually copied over as if it were a primitive.
Objects are copied by reference instead of by value.
 **/
 
 var hatter = {
    color: 'blue',
    style: 'snapback',
};


hatter.color = 'black'; // => referencing the above object and making changes
// not changing the entire object
// {color: "black", style: "snapback"}



/**
 * Copy by value
 **/
 
 
// When we assign these variables to other variables using =, we copy the value to the new variable.
// They are copied by value.
var x = 10;
var y = 'abc';
var a = x;
var b = y;
console.log(x, y, a, b); // -> 10, 'abc', 10, 'abc'
